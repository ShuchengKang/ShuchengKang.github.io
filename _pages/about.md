I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Computational Robotics Lab](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/) of [Harvard SEAS](https://seas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Prof. Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/). Before that, I received my Bacholar degree in [Department of Electronic Engineering](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University at 2023, where I had the fortune to work with [Prof. Jianyu Chen](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jychen/). In the summer of 2022, I had a remote internship in CMU's [Intelligent Control Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/intelligent-control-lab/), under the guidance of [Prof. Changliu Liu](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/changliu-liu/).

<!-- My long-term goal is to provide both theoretical foundations and computational tools for the next generation of robotic systems. Currently, I am focused on solving large-scale SDP problems arising from the Moment-SOS Hierarchy, which are commonly encountered in robotics applications such as trajectory optimization and geometric perception. -->
